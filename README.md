by h!gh voltage (http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197982482557/)


This program simplifies the process of getting the wear float values of items.

How To run this without launching the exe (if you don't want to):

1. Download wearfinder.py
2. Install Python 2.7.8: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-278/
3. Run IDLE (Python GUI)
4. Press File > Open > browse to wearfinder.py and open it
5. Enter your API Key in the script (ex. API_KEY = "4AK8793AJ23423KLS2347")

    Obtain your API Key here: https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey
6. Press F5 to run the script



Usage:

The programm will ask you to enter the Steamid64 of the user's profile.

To get it, go to steamidfinder.com and follow their instructions.

Note: A Steamid64 always starts with '765'



After entering the Steamid64, press ENTER to list all items, or insert a specific Item ID (useful if a user has multiple items of the same type).


Notes:

The steam API Server is known to be very bad and often gives an empty response. Don't expect to have success every time... :(
