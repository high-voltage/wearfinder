CS:GO Item Wear Finder
by h!gh voltage (http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197982482557/)


This program simplifies the process of getting the wear float values of items.

How To run this without launching the exe (if you don't want to):

1. Download wearfinder.py
2. Install Python 2.7.8: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-278/
3. Run IDLE (Python GUI)
4. Press File > Open > browse to wearfinder.py and open it
5. Press F5 to run the script



Usage:

The programm will ask you to enter the Steamid64 of the user's profile.

To get it, go to steamidfinder.com and follow their instructions.

Note: A Steamid64 always starts with '765'



From now on, you can let the program collect every tradable item and get their wear value, or you can enter a specific Item ID.

To get an Item ID, go to the user's inventory, click on an item, copy its link and paste it somewhere.

Now copy the number after the last _ and paste it in the prompt.



If you chose to enter 'no' in the prompt, the program will give you a list with every item and a number infront of it.

In the next prompt, enter the number infront of the item name and you will receive the wear value.

If you chose to enter a Item ID, the program will give you its wear value directly.


Notes:

The steam API Server is known to be very bad and often gives an empty response. Don't expect to have success every time... :(
